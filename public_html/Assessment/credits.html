		<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
		<p>
		The Admin webpage uses the HTTP method "GET" to send user input to 
		the database connected to the web server, because the intended
		user input on this webpage is not of a sensitive nature. Therefore, 
		it is not a significant security risk for the user input to be 
		visible in the URL, which occurs when the GET method is used. The PHP
		code involved in interfacing with the database is vulnerable to SQL
		injection and therefore, should be modified to make use of parameterized
		queries to ensure that the SQL queries are not modified to carry out an
		unintended purpose. This would prevent database failure and data loss.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Users should read the form on the Admin webpage carefully to ensure
		they are only entering the information requested and be cautious of
		what is is in their clipboard if copy and pasting into the form so
		that they do not enter sensitive information. Users should not input
		sensitive information because this website uses the HTTP protocol,
		so HTTP requests including user input are unencrypted. This means
		if sensitive user input is intercepted by a hacker, it can be
		quickly used for malicious purposes because the hacker does not
		have to perform the time consuming process of decryption. Additionally,
		users should not input sensitive information because the input is visible
		in the URL due the use of the GET method. This means that sensitive
		information will be stored in the history of the browser and can be
		obtained without permission, by other users who use the same computer.
		Furthermore, if a user bookmarks a page after submitting sensitive
		information, this will cause the same security vulnerablity.
